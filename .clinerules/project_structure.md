## Best Practices for This Structure

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Product**: Strategic and business-focused content
- **Doc**: Technical documentation for developers
- **Examples**: Practical, runnable code demonstrations

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- Start with high-level overview (README)
- Provide quick start for immediate value
- Deep dive documentation for advanced users
- Practical examples for hands-on learning

### 3. Consistent Formatting
- Use clear headings and navigation
- Include code examples with explanations
- Provide installation and setup instructions
- Link between related documents

### 4. Maintenance Strategy
- Keep documentation in sync with code
- Update examples when APIs change
- Regularly review and update personas/metrics
- Version control all documentation

### 5. User-Centric Organization
- Organize by user journey and use cases
- Provide multiple entry points (quickstart, examples, reference)
- Include troubleshooting and common issues
- Clear navigation between sections

## Adaptation Guidelines

### For Different Project Types

**API/Library Projects:**
- Emphasize API reference and SDK examples
- Include client library documentation
- Focus on integration patterns

**Web Applications:**
- Add user interface documentation
- Include deployment and hosting guides
- Document user workflows and features

**Enterprise Software:**
- Expand security and compliance documentation
- Include admin guides and configuration
- Add monitoring and operations guides

**Open Source Projects:**
- Include contribution guidelines
- Add community and governance documentation
- Provide issue templates and support channels

### Customization Tips

1. **Adjust directory names** to match your domain (e.g., `api/` instead of `lib/`)
2. **Modify file templates** to match your project's complexity and audience
3. **Scale documentation depth** based on project size and user base
4. **Add domain-specific sections** as needed (e.g., `security/`, `operations/`)
5. **Include visual aids** like diagrams and screenshots where appropriate

This structure provides a solid foundation for technical projects while remaining flexible enough to adapt to specific needs and domains.
