# Interaction Files Structure Standard

## Overview

This document defines the standardized structure for all interaction flow documentation in the `/product/interactions/` directory. This template ensures consistency, completeness, and cross-referencing between related user interaction flows.

## Template Structure

### File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names ending in `_flow.md`, `_journey.md`, or `_interactions.md`
- Examples: `mobile_app_flow.md`, `primary_user_journey.md`, `web_signup_journey.md`

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Content Depth Standards

#### Minimum Required Content
- **Overview & Context:** Must include at least 2 target personas, 3 business objectives, 3 success metrics
- **User Journey Flow:** Must include primary path with 3+ major steps, success criteria for each step
- **Detailed Interactions:** Must include either UI/UX specs or technical requirements (or both)
- **Cross-Platform:** Must address web, mobile, and offline scenarios (even if by reference)
- **Business Logic:** Must include conversion points and engagement metrics
- **Technical Implementation:** Must include performance considerations and error handling
- **Success Criteria:** Must include user experience, business, and technical metrics

#### Recommended Additional Content
- Alternative scenarios with specific use cases
- Detailed code block diagrams for complex flows
- Comprehensive cross-references to related files
- Quantified success targets with measurement methods

### 2. Cross-Reference Guidelines

#### When to Cross-Reference
- **Technical Details:** Reference implementation files for complex technical specifications
- **Related Flows:** Reference other interaction files for connected user journeys
- **Shared Components:** Reference common UI/UX elements defined elsewhere
- **Business Logic:** Reference strategy documents for business context

#### Cross-Reference Format
```markdown
*[Cross-reference: See [filename.md] section [X] for [specific topic]]*
```

#### Examples
```markdown
*[Cross-reference: See mobile_app_flow.md section 7 for offline implementation details]*
*[Cross-reference: See web_signup_journey.md for initial user onboarding flow]*
*[Cross-reference: See primary_user_journey.md for daily usage scenarios]*
```

### 3. Heading Hierarchy Standards

#### Required Structure
- **H1:** File title only
- **H2:** Seven main sections (1-7)
- **H3:** Sub-sections within main sections
- **H4:** Detailed breakdowns and specifications

#### Numbering Convention
- Main sections: `## 1. Section Name`
- Sub-sections: `### Sub-section Name`
- Details: `#### Specific Detail Name`
- Steps: `**1. Step Name**` (bold, not heading)

### 4. Code Block Standards

#### When to Use Code Blocks
- Complex user interface hierarchies
- Technical implementation flows
- Multi-step process diagrams
- System architecture representations

#### Code Block Format
```
[Descriptive Title]
├── [Main Component]
│   ├── [Sub-component with details]
│   ├── [Sub-component with details]
│   └── [Sub-component with details]
├── [Main Component]
│   └── [Sub-component with details]
└── [Main Component]
```

### 5. Success Criteria Guidelines

#### Three Types Required
1. **User Experience Metrics:** How users feel and behave
2. **Business Metrics:** Revenue, growth, and business impact
3. **Technical Metrics:** Performance, reliability, and scalability

#### Format Standard
```markdown
- **[Metric Name]:** [Specific target] [measurement method] [timeframe]
```

#### Examples
```markdown
- **App Launch Speed:** Under 2 seconds consistently measured via analytics
