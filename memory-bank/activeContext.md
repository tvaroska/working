# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in active development with the following focus areas:

1. **Core Functionality Completion**: Ensuring the basic pipeline (feed collection → AI summarization → web display) is working correctly
2. **UI Refinement**: Improving the user interface and experience in the Flet app
3. **Error Handling**: Enhancing the system's resilience to failures in feed parsing and API calls
4. **Containerization**: Finalizing the Docker deployment approach for production

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the main web UI using Flet framework with list and detail views
- Set up the data processing pipeline with Google Vertex AI integration
- Created Docker configuration for containerized deployment
- Added structured logging for better debugging and monitoring
- Implemented error handling with retry mechanisms for API calls
- Added support for Markdown rendering in article summaries
- Configured the application to run both locally and in Docker containers

## Next Steps

Priority tasks for upcoming development:

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls
   - Optimize the loading time for the web interface
   - Add pagination for the article list to handle large datasets

2. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Add loading indicators during content fetching
   - Improve responsiveness for mobile devices
   - Implement dark mode support
   - Enhance navigation between list and detail views

3. **Content Improvements**:
   - Refine the AI prompt engineering for better summaries
   - Add filtering options for articles by source or date
   - Implement search functionality across articles
   - Improve handling of different content types (text, video, podcasts)

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - Set up automated deployment pipeline
   - Configure monitoring and alerting
   - Implement a scheduled job for regular content updates

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Design Decisions Under Consideration
- Whether to implement user authentication for personalized feeds
- How to handle images and media content from RSS feeds
- Approach for optimizing API costs while maintaining content freshness
- Strategy for effective content categorization and tagging
- Potential implementation of a caching layer to reduce API calls

### Technical Challenges Being Addressed
- Managing API rate limits without affecting user experience
- Ensuring consistent summary quality across different sources
- Optimizing memory usage in the Flet application
- Balancing between detailed summaries and processing costs
- Handling different content types appropriately (articles, videos, podcasts)

### Exploration Areas
- Addition of more sources beyond RSS feeds (e.g., Twitter, research papers)
- Implementation of user feedback mechanisms for summary quality
- Potential for offline content availability
- Integration with external reading list services
- Enhancing the summary generation with more targeted prompts for different content types

## Current Questions & Open Issues

1. What is the optimal frequency for feed updates to balance freshness and API costs?
2. How can we improve the semantic understanding in AI summaries for technical content?
3. What metrics should we track to measure the effectiveness of the summaries?
4. How should we handle content that requires authentication or has paywall restrictions?
5. What is the most effective way to categorize and tag content automatically?
6. How can we optimize the Vertex AI usage to reduce costs while maintaining quality?
