# Progress

## What Works

### Collection Pipeline
- ✅ RSS feed parsing and article extraction
- ✅ HTTP client implementation for content fetching
- ✅ Proper date filtering for new content
- ✅ Content preparation for AI processing
- ✅ Asynchronous processing for multiple feeds

### AI Processing
- ✅ Integration with Google Vertex AI
- ✅ Generation of short and long-form summaries
- ✅ Data schema validation using Pydantic
- ✅ Structured storage of processing results
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic

### Web Interface
- ✅ Basic Flet application setup
- ✅ List view for article browsing
- ✅ Detail view for individual articles
- ✅ Routing between views
- ✅ Markdown rendering for summaries
- ✅ Responsive container layouts

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Docker configuration with multi-stage builds
- ✅ UV package management
- ✅ Structured logging setup

## What's Left to Build

### User Experience Enhancements
- ⬜ Loading indicators for async operations
- ⬜ Error states in the UI
- ⬜ Pagination for large article sets
- ⬜ Dark mode support
- ⬜ Better mobile experience optimizations

### Content Management
- ⬜ Content categorization and tagging
- ⬜ Search functionality
- ⬜ Filtering options (by source, date, etc.)
- ⬜ Sorting options for article lists

### Backend Improvements
- ⬜ Caching layer to reduce API calls
- ⬜ Performance optimizations for large datasets
- ⬜ Automated content refresh scheduling
- ⬜ Media content handling (images, etc.)

### Infrastructure
- ⬜ CI/CD pipeline setup
- ⬜ Monitoring and alerting configuration
- ⬜ Automated backup procedures
- ⬜ Scalability improvements

## Current Status
The project is in a functional alpha state. The core pipeline is working, allowing:

1. Collection of articles from configured RSS feeds
2. Processing and summarization using Google Vertex AI
3. Presentation of content in a basic web interface

The application can be run both locally and via Docker. The core functionality is implemented, but there are opportunities for refinement and enhancement in both the UI and backend processes.

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
- **Memory Usage**: The Flet application may use more memory than expected with large datasets
- **API Rate Limits**: Occasional throttling from Google Vertex AI during peak usage
- **Long Processing Times**: Initial article collection and processing can take significant time with many feeds
- **Error Handling Gaps**: Some edge cases in RSS feed parsing may not be properly handled

### UI/UX Issues
- **Loading Feedback**: Lack of clear loading indicators during content fetching operations
- **Mobile Layout**: Some responsiveness issues on smaller screens
- **Navigation**: Back button behavior could be improved for better user experience
- **Text Rendering**: Occasional formatting issues with certain Markdown content in summaries

### Content Issues
- **Summary Quality**: AI-generated summaries may occasionally miss key points from technical articles
- **Duplicate Detection**: Current deduplication logic could be improved for similar content across feeds
- **Media Handling**: Images and other media from original articles are not currently preserved

## Next Milestone Goals
1. Implement content categorization and filtering
2. Add search functionality
3. Improve mobile responsiveness
4. Implement loading states in UI
5. Set up automated refresh schedule
