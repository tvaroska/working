# Progress

## What Works

### Collection Pipeline
- ✅ RSS feed parsing and article extraction
- ✅ HTTP client implementation for content fetching
- ✅ Proper date filtering for new content
- ✅ Content preparation for AI processing
- ✅ Asynchronous processing for multiple feeds
- ✅ Handling of different content types (including YouTube videos)

### AI Processing
- ✅ Integration with Google Vertex AI
- ✅ Generation of short and long-form summaries
- ✅ Data schema validation using Pydantic
- ✅ Structured storage of processing results
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic with tenacity library
- ✅ Rate limiting via semaphore to manage API quotas

### Web Interface
- ✅ Basic Flet application setup
- ✅ List view for article browsing
- ✅ Detail view for individual articles
- ✅ Routing between views
- ✅ Markdown rendering for summaries
- ✅ Responsive container layouts
- ✅ Clean UI with card-based design and proper spacing

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Docker configuration with multi-stage builds
- ✅ UV package management
- ✅ Structured logging setup with contextual information
- ✅ Command-line arguments for flexible configuration

## What's Left to Build

### User Experience Enhancements
- ⬜ Loading indicators for async operations
- ⬜ Error states in the UI
- ⬜ Pagination for large article sets
- ⬜ Dark mode support
- ⬜ Better mobile experience optimizations
- ⬜ Click-to-expand functionality for long summaries

### Content Management
- ⬜ Content categorization and tagging
- ⬜ Search functionality
- ⬜ Filtering options (by source, date, etc.)
- ⬜ Sorting options for article lists
- ⬜ Source attribution and metadata display

### Backend Improvements
- ⬜ Caching layer to reduce API calls
- ⬜ Performance optimizations for large datasets
- ⬜ Automated content refresh scheduling
- ⬜ Media content handling (images, etc.)
- ⬜ Enhanced error recovery for specific content types

### Infrastructure
- ⬜ CI/CD pipeline setup
- ⬜ Monitoring and alerting configuration
- ⬜ Automated backup procedures
- ⬜ Scalability improvements
- ⬜ Configuration management for different environments

## Current Status
The project is in a functional alpha state. The core pipeline is working, allowing:

1. Collection of articles from configured RSS feeds (currently set up with 15 technology and AI-focused feeds)
2. Processing and summarization using Google Vertex AI (with both short and detailed markdown summaries)
3. Presentation of content in a clean web interface with list and detail views

The application can be run both locally and via Docker. The core functionality is implemented, but there are opportunities for refinement and enhancement in both the UI and backend processes.

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
- **Memory Usage**: The Flet application may use more memory than expected with large datasets
- **API Rate Limits**: Occasional throttling from Google Vertex AI during peak usage
- **Long Processing Times**: Initial article collection and processing can take significant time with many feeds
- **Error Handling Gaps**: Some edge cases in RSS feed parsing may not be properly handled
- **Resource Management**: Need better handling of Vertex AI resource exhaustion

### UI/UX Issues
- **Loading Feedback**: Lack of clear loading indicators during content fetching operations
- **Mobile Layout**: Some responsiveness issues on smaller screens
- **Navigation**: Back button behavior could be improved for better user experience
- **Text Rendering**: Occasional formatting issues with certain Markdown content in summaries
- **List Performance**: Potential performance issues with long lists of articles

### Content Issues
- **Summary Quality**: AI-generated summaries may occasionally miss key points from technical articles
- **Duplicate Detection**: Current deduplication logic could be improved for similar content across feeds
- **Media Handling**: Images and other media from original articles are not currently preserved
- **Content Type Handling**: Different approaches needed for different content types (articles vs. videos)

## Next Milestone Goals
1. Implement content categorization and filtering
2. Add search functionality
3. Improve mobile responsiveness
4. Implement loading states in UI
5. Set up automated refresh schedule
6. Optimize API usage to reduce costs
