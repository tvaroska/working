# Two-Zone Network Model

> The Bridge is a **network-boundary mediator (DMZ)**. Isolation is enforced **at the network layer only** — not by application-level tenant scoping. This is core, not deferred: a credible platform showcase — and any real production deployment — has to show the trust boundary.

```
External zone (untrusted)  ─ingress→  Bridge (DMZ)  ←Agent Identity→  Internal zone (trusted)
 provider/party agents                Agent Runtime                    backend / servicer agents
 + host portals
```

- **Agent Gateway = external ingress.** All external traffic (both [[bridge-edges|edges]]) enters through the Gateway — routing, access-control, per-party auth scoping. A party agent can address **only its own leg's context**.
- **Agent Identity = workload identity.** The Bridge↔backend link and the Bridge's calls to managed services authenticate as workloads (mutual TLS). The internal zone never accepts unauthenticated calls.
- **Carrier-vs-carrier confidentiality is addressing, not a wall.** Competing carriers share the external zone; a carrier can't see another's bid because it can't address another leg's context (Gateway scoping + per-leg isolation).
- **No per-customer logical multi-tenancy.** One deployment serves one trust domain; cross-org tenant scoping is deferred.

**Deployment-only, not a seam.** Unlike the storage [[bridge-seams|seams]], the Gateway has no local equivalent — local dev runs no gateway. So the deploy path provides **validated deploy-spec builders** for the gateway, workload identity, and network zone that fold into the deployment spec only when a gateway is configured. Provisioning the runtime is separate from provisioning the gateway.
