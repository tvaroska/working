# Collect (casefiles)

> Collect breaks the "one exchange ≈ one document" assumption: a casefile assembles a **set** of documents against a requirements list — and the **app decides** what's needed and when it's complete. New in the ADK design: the Bridge no longer sits completeness-blind — it makes a **best-effort** proposal from the skill's satisfaction description and chases the delta — but it holds **no final word**; the app still decides. It runs as a **multi-turn conversation**, not a workflow: no DSL, no engine.

**The loop is the mechanism.** The exchange is already a durable multi-turn A2A conversation ([[bridge-aggregate-model|context → task → messages]]). Collect just rides it — every judgment is a *turn*, not code:

```
Bridge: collect → parse/classify → disposition (per doc) → update ledger
Bridge: best-effort read of the skill's rule → propose what's still outstanding
Bridge → app:  Collection status + "still needed / looks done"  (advisory)
app  → Bridge: the decision — requirements list + done?         (app owns this)
Bridge: chase the outstanding items ─┐
        ▲────────────────────────────┘  repeat until the app says done
```

**The loop is idle-driven over long horizons.** A real casefile fills over days or **weeks**, so the loop is not a process that stays running — the continuation lives in the durable exchange, and each turn is triggered by a party arrival, a [[bridge-proactive|clock alarm]], or an HITL resume. Because the per-turn reply (`next_requirements`) is a pure function of `(status, ledger)`, neither side needs to *sit* in the loop between turns. See [[bridge-long-running|long-running collection]]. On the calling side the loop runs as a [[bridge-a2a-consumer|native `RemoteA2aAgent` consumer]] that pauses on `INPUT_REQUIRED` between turns rather than blocking (`adr-0009`). 📋 The Address loop is now wired agent-side (`document_bridge` collect → authoritative `check_completeness` gate → chase if not done), with one durable exchange **`context_id`** threaded across rounds via session state (`adr-0010`, `AgentTool` interim).

**The Requirements payload is a list, not a language.** Each turn the agent returns a flat, fixed-schema to-do list — **data, not rules**:

```
requirements:
  - { item: "proof of identity", status: required, doctype_hint: gov-id }
  - { item: "proof of address",  status: required }
  - { item: "bank reference",    status: optional }
done: false
```

The status vocabulary is the whole language: `required | optional | satisfied | waived`. This stays DSL-free because **conditionals are never encoded** — "self-employed → tax return" is *reasoned* next turn once the fact is learned from the parsed ledger, not a Bridge-evaluated trigger. The same holds for the skill's satisfaction rule: it is a **natural-language description** the interpreting agent reasons over, **not a formal rule language** — so the Bridge's best-effort completeness (below) keeps the loop DSL-free.

**Two versioned artifacts, two owners:**

| Artifact | Owner | Source of truth for |
|---|---|---|
| **Requirements** | **app** — decides *what's needed* and *is it done* (the Bridge proposes a best-effort list from the skill's satisfaction description, but never enforces) | *what's needed* and *is it done* |
| **Collection status** | Bridge | *what we have* — the classified ledger: per-doc state, rejections, outstanding, and the best-effort "still needed" proposal |

**The Sense A/B line, precisely.** The Bridge says "this parsed doc is a valid `gov-id`" (sense A); deciding "that `gov-id` satisfies *proof of identity*, and the set is now complete" is sense B. Sense A is **always** the Bridge, and authoritative. Sense B — completeness of the set — **the app decides**; the Bridge now makes a **best-effort** assessment from the skill's prose rule (proposing what's outstanding, chasing) but holds **no final word**. So the Bridge maps docs → doctypes authoritatively, *proposes* doctypes → `done`, and leaves the call to the app rather than guessing. It classifies, chases, dispositions, and reports live throughout ([[bridge-disposition|disposition]]).

**`required` / `optional` is a chase knob, not a judgment.** Those statuses tune the Bridge's mechanical behavior — chase `required` hard on the SLA, nudge `optional` gently or not at all, never block on it. Sense A on the Bridge side, driven by the Bridge's best-effort read of the skill's rule and refined by the app's decision.

**Consequences.** Intake gains **classification** (identify an unlabeled doc's doctype against the candidate label space, or flag it wrong/unrequested) before extraction; the demo is a [[bridge-skills|process skill]] whose pattern is Collect and whose candidate doctypes make the requirement a *set*.

**Bounded vs emergent — Collect ships in two steps, and the two steps set *how much the Bridge can pre-chase*.** Collect debuts *bounded* in **Phase 1** as the **Address** warm-up: a fixed **alternative-satisfaction** rule — prove an address with either one government ID or two bills from different companies — over a candidate-doctype label space, with **no Bridge-owned typed slots**. Because the rule is known up front it lives in the **skill** as prose, so the **Bridge can best-effort completeness** (the OR, the count-to-two, the distinct-issuer check — sense B) over its own **classified ledger** and chase the missing bill hard — but the **app still decides done**. The *emergent* form — requirements that mutate on learned facts, conditional items, N-supplier scale, a new industry, added live — is the **RFP** demo (Phase 3); there the rule **can't be pinned up front**, so the Bridge's best-effort is thinner and the **app carries more of the reasoning**, supplying the mutating requirements list turn by turn. The decision owner never changes (the app); what shifts is how much the Bridge can pre-chase. Phase 3 generalizes the Phase-1 slice; it does not invent the pattern.

**Address and RFP are the *same* loop.** Both are exactly the multi-turn conversation above — the only difference is *how much the skill pins down up front*: Address gives a **fixed** rule the Bridge can best-effort and chase hard; RFP gives an **emergent** one the app mutates turn by turn. Either way the **app decides done** and the **Bridge code is the same** — the reusability thesis without a DSL. `Request (pull)` is just a one-turn Collect (one item, no follow-up).
