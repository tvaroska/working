# [String Theory is “Fashion,” Penrose Said. We Finally Have a Response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOiBMWMzosY)

String theory frequently faces criticism, often cited as an example of foundational issues in physics. This video focuses on Roger Penrose, a Nobel laureate known for his work on black holes and a respected critic of string theory. His 2016 book, "Fashion, Faith, and Fantasy," includes string theory under the 'fashion' category, arguing it contains significant problems that proponents tend to overlook. Penrose's background in mathematics, coupled with his ability to communicate complex ideas in popular science books, makes his critiques particularly impactful within the physics community.

Penrose's primary criticisms revolve around string theory's proposed extra dimensions. While these dimensions are theorized to be tiny and curled up, preventing direct observation, he argues their omnipresence means they should be excitable by the universe's total energy, leading to observable effects that are currently missing. He posits that even the energy from the Sun reaching Earth in one second would be far more than enough to excite these extra dimensions throughout the entire universe, implying an observational contradiction if the theory were true. Another concern he raises is that the equations describing spacetime in string theory contain infinitely many correction terms to Einstein's equations, requiring an infinite amount of initial data, a problem string theory was supposed to resolve.

A recent paper by Matěj Krátký and James Read directly addresses Penrose's points. They contend that Penrose misinterprets the energy required to excite extra dimensions, clarifying that it would need to be localized Planck energy, not the total cosmic energy. However, Krátký and Read *do* agree with Penrose on the issue of infinite correction terms, acknowledging it as a genuine open problem that demands proper analysis. The video concludes by framing this intellectual exchange as an excellent example of how scientific discourse, through rigorous criticism and detailed response, drives progress in understanding fundamental physics, highlighting the importance of continually challenging and refining scientific theories.
