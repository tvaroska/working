# [SpaceX Starship Flight 11 Booster Breakthrough Achieved! Ready to Become New Space Station...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN4rG8J-PnM)

The video highlights new footage from SpaceX's Starship Flight 11, showcasing a significant advancement in booster landing capabilities. This includes a 13-second "Super Heavy hover" phase, where the booster's 13 engines incrementally shut down to 5 and then to 3, allowing for precise control and stability during descent. This staged engine shutdown is a crucial test for the upcoming V3 Starship configuration, designed to facilitate the innovative Megazilla catch system, aiming for enhanced accuracy and fuel efficiency. However, the flight also resulted in booster debris, including composite overwrapped pressure vessels, washing ashore on the Mexican coast. While initial concerns about marine life harm (a deceased dolphin) were clarified as coincidental, the incident underscores the importance of the Megazilla system to mitigate environmental risks associated with ocean splashdowns.

Amidst SpaceX's rapid technological progress, a debate continues over humanity's next great destination: the Moon or Mars. Tom Mueller, a former SpaceX founding engineer and the mind behind the Falcon and Dragon engines, has entered this discussion with his new company, Impulse Space. Unlike SpaceX's Mars-first philosophy, Impulse Space aims to provide reliable and cost-effective cargo deliveries to the Moon, planning to deliver up to 6 tons of payload annually by 2028. This lunar focus is intended to bridge a critical gap in cargo delivery capabilities and support NASA's Artemis program, serving as a vital testing ground for future missions deeper into the solar system and offering valuable resources like Helium-3.

The video also explores the emerging landscape of commercial space stations, poised to succeed the aging International Space Station. Several promising projects are taking shape, each with unique strengths. The Starship Space Station stands out for its immense size and potential for vast habitable volume, significantly exceeding the ISS, with cost-effectiveness driven by reusable components. The Vast Space Station, already having completed production of its Haven-1 module for a planned launch next year, boasts strong partnerships with SpaceX for launch and resupply, and ambitious expansion plans including Starlink integration. Axiom Space Station, leveraging its initial attachment to the ISS for support, is building specialized modules with a focus on crew comfort and research. Finally, Orbital Reef, a collaboration between Blue Origin and Sierra Space, is advancing inflatable habitat technology, offering spacious and flexible living areas. These diverse projects represent a new era of human presence in orbit, with competition driving innovation and laying the groundwork for future deep space exploration.
