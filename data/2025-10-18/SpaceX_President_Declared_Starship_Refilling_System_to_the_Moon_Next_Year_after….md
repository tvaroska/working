Reaching the Moon with Starship presents a significant challenge due to the massive fuel requirements for the journey. SpaceX plans to address this through in-orbit refueling, a complex process that involves transferring propellant between spacecraft in space. Despite the technical demands, SpaceX executives, including President Gwynne Shotwell and Elon Musk, express strong confidence in their ability to achieve this, possibly as early as next year. Their optimism stems from years of perfecting systems and techniques for in-orbit operations, building on their successful experience with Dragon spacecraft docking with the International Space Station (ISS).

SpaceX has two main approaches for refueling Starship: direct propellant transfer between two Starships or utilizing an orbital fuel depot. While the latter requires a durable depot capable of storing cryogenic fuels long-term, direct transfer between two identical Starships is considered a more straightforward problem than docking with the ISS, which SpaceX already performs routinely. The company plans to conduct refueling demonstration missions next year, starting with tests to ensure two Starships can meet and connect in orbit, paving the way for future missions like uncrewed lunar landings and eventually crewed missions to the Moon and Mars.

The success of Starship's in-orbit refueling is crucial for humanity's long-term space exploration goals. Its massive payload capacity will be essential for building lunar infrastructure, transporting equipment, and sustaining operations on the Moon and beyond, accelerating the establishment of a permanent human presence. However, numerous challenges remain, including scaling up Starship production, perfecting ground infrastructure for rapid launch cadence, and mastering the storage and handling of cryogenic propellants in space. Despite these formidable obstacles, SpaceX's relentless innovation and commitment, demonstrated through its consistent success with Dragon missions, position them to overcome these hurdles and achieve a groundbreaking leap in space technology, bringing humanity closer to becoming a multi-planetary species.
