This article focuses on image-text models.\n\n### Key Architectures\nTwo main architectures are discussed: Unified Embedding Decoder and Cross-Modality Attention.  The former concatenates image and text embeddings before feeding them into a decoder-only LLM; the latter integrates them directly into the attention layer.\n\n### Model Training\nTraining generally starts with a pre-trained text-only LLM.  The image encoder (often CLIP or a variant) and a projector (linear layer or MLP) are added.  Training involves stages: (1) pretraining the projector, (2) finetuning with the LLM unfrozen, and sometimes (3) additional finetuning for specific tasks.\n\n### Recent Models Reviewed\nThe article reviews several recent multimodal models: Llama 3.2 (cross-attention), Molmo (decoder-only), NVLM (decoder-only, cross-attention, and hybrid), Qwen2-VL (dynamic resolution), Pixtral 12B (decoder-only), MM1.5 (decoder-only, mixture-of-experts), Aria (cross-attention, mixture-of-experts), and Baichuan-Omni (decoder-only).

Finetuning for classification provides a straightforward entry point into LLM adaptation.\n\n### Two Finetuning Methods\nThe article contrasts instruction finetuning (requiring task-specific instructions) with classification finetuning (predicting predefined classes).  Classification is more specialized but requires fewer resources.\n\n### Adapting the Model\nThe process involves freezing most of the pretrained LLM's layers and replacing the output layer with a smaller one tailored to the number of classes (e.g., two for spam/not spam).  The last transformer block and final LayerNorm are also made trainable for improved performance.\n\n### Focusing on the Last Token\nDue to the causal attention mask in GPT-like models, the last token in an input sequence contains the most contextual information.  Therefore, finetuning focuses on this token for classification.\n\n### Experimental Results\nExperiments demonstrate that the model achieves high accuracy (around 96%). Additional experiments explore various aspects, such as the effect of training all layers vs. only the last layer, comparing GPT to BERT, disabling the causal mask, model size impact, using LoRA, and the effect of padding.

Their predictions regarding open-source LLMs were overly pessimistic; they underestimated the advancements and funding secured by open-source LLM companies.\n\n### Key Predictions and Outcomes\n\nOpenAI's GPT-4 pricing didn't decrease as dramatically as anticipated, while the success of Gemini surprised them.  Open-source models like Llama 3 performed better than projected.  They also note underestimating the impact of smaller, equally performant models, a trend they call \"test-time compute\".\n\n### Top Posts of 2024\n\nTheir most viewed post, \"Throw more AI at your problems,\" unexpectedly surpassed others focusing on market analysis or AI strategy. This shows the rising interest in compound AI.\n\n### Lessons Learned\n\nThree major lessons emerged: 1. AI companies must deliver concrete business value. 2. Customer trust is paramount, exceeding the importance of overly technical evaluations.  3. AI UX requires continuous innovation to match AI advancements.

Read now to learn more!", "long": "### Compound AI Achieved AGI?\n\nThe authors contend that current Large Language Models (LLMs) have already achieved Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).  They challenge the common definition of AGI as residing within a single, self-contained system.\n\n###  Redefining AGI\n\nInstead, they propose AGI is achievable through the composition of multiple models working together.  This \"compound AI\" approach mimics human intelligence where diverse skills are combined.  Just as a human is not uniformly skilled in all areas, individual models specialize, enhancing overall system capabilities.\n\n### Countering the Arguments\n\nThe authors address potential counterarguments. The idea that compound AI only simulates true AGI is challenged by the emergent nature of intelligence itself. The analogy of the human brain's collaborative neural networks is drawn to illustrate this. The limitation of a single model isn't a limitation of AGI as a concept.\n\n### The Intelligence Gap\n\nWhile acknowledging that current AI systems do not surpass human abilities in all areas (physical intelligence, for example), they emphasize that surpassing human intelligence is not a prerequisite for AGI. LLMs already perform tasks exceeding human capabilities in specific domains (speed of information retrieval, for example).\n\n### The Conclusion\n\nThe authors conclude that AGI is not a singular event in the future but rather a present capability.  The development of generalizable intelligence is a matter of refining existing components and investment, not fundamental breakthroughs.  They encourage a shift in focus from the AGI debate to further exploration of consciousness and the ethical implications of highly intelligent systems.", "url": "https://frontierai.substack.com/p/compound-ai-is-agi"}, {"title": "The end of scaling laws doesn't matter", "short": "LLM progress has slowed, but that's irrelevant!

Instead of focusing on a comprehensive plan, they suggest a simpler approach: **use more AI**. They believe that a centralized strategy won't effectively address the diverse needs across an organization's various departments. \n\n### Decentralize AI adoption. \n\nThe authors recommend empowering individual teams to select AI tools based on their specific needs and evaluation criteria.  This approach mirrors a business strategy where each department decides their own hiring practices rather than a singular company-wide strategy. \n\n### Effective AI implementation needs thoughtful evaluation.\n\nWhile a general AI strategy is deemed unproductive, having clear evaluation criteria is crucial.  Teams must prioritize factors such as speed, accuracy, and user experience, creating precise criteria for selecting suitable tools.  The focus should be on the practical impact rather than broad, abstract societal implications. \n\n### Embrace experimentation and failure.\n\nThe authors emphasize the importance of experimentation and accepting some inevitable failures. The early stage of AI development makes perfect decisions challenging.  Treating AI adoption as an iterative learning process will sharpen evaluation skills over time and increase the chance of finding valuable applications. \n\n### Don't let bureaucracy slow you down. \n\nOverly bureaucratic processes and central decision-making bodies often hamper AI adoption.  Removing unnecessary obstacles within an organization facilitates quicker integration and allows teams to leverage AI benefits promptly.

The increased use of \"test-time compute\" for better reasoning results in significantly slower response times for applications.\n\n### Latency Concerns\nThe rising use of more powerful models and the inherent increase in compute time for each prompt leads to slower user experience. Although AI is theoretically faster and more accurate than humans, user expectations don't always reflect that.  The solution isn't just waiting for faster models; a new paradigm is needed.\n\n### Lessons from the Past\nThe challenges of latency aren't new.  In 2016, similar issues were overcome by minimizing latency in ML systems. Techniques like model cascades, where simpler models are used first, allowing more complex models to be employed only when necessary, were effective in optimizing the response time.\n\n### Solutions for Faster AI\nSeveral key strategies are suggested:\n\n*   **Use Multiple Models:** Don't rely on only the most powerful model for every task. Smaller models can handle easier tasks quickly, improving the overall efficiency. \n*   **Ensemble Models and Parallel Inference:** Employ model ensembles (multiple models working together) and parallel inference to minimize latency. Faster, cheaper models can provide quick answers, and more powerful ones can refine the results concurrently. \n*   **AsyncAI:** Return initial results promptly and refine them later.

The authors, from RunLLM, propose this as a superior alternative to relying solely on a single, powerful LLM.\n\n### Breaking Down Complexity\n\nInstead of tackling a problem with one massive LLM call, the authors advocate for breaking it into smaller, manageable components. Each component can be handled by a smaller, more efficient LLM. This makes it easier to fine-tune individual steps and improve overall system reliability, lowering costs and latency.\n\n### Addressing Cost and Latency Concerns\n\nThe authors acknowledge that multiple LLM calls can increase cost and latency.  They suggest addressing latency through parallelization and asynchronous workflows.  Cost-effectiveness is improved by using smaller, more appropriate models for individual tasks, instead of a large, computationally expensive model for the entire problem.\n\n### Improved Resilience and Incremental Development\n\nThis approach improves resilience to prompt hacking attempts as a problem in one step won't affect the entire system.  Further, it enables incremental improvements.  A generic model can be initially used and replaced later with a more refined, smaller, and cheaper model as more data becomes available.\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThe main point is that adding more LLM calls, creating a compound AI system, is a powerful technique often underutilized.

This method relies on intuition and expectation rather than empirical metrics, essentially assessing whether the LLM gave the expected answer.\n\n### Unexpected Benefits\n\nHowever, after numerous customer interactions, they've found unexpected advantages.  Incremental improvements using this approach fosters trust by addressing specific user needs. Real-world requests often reveal out-of-distribution inputs that standard tests sets miss, offering valuable insights. Furthermore, some user feedback (like preference for conciseness or detail) is not easily quantifiable, thus requiring interactive feedback.\n\n### Limitations of Other Evals\n\nThe authors acknowledge the value of metrics but highlight existing limitations.  General-purpose benchmarks like MMLU are too broad; task-specific leaderboards don't directly evaluate individual product performance.  Their own framework (measuring correctness, coherence, conciseness, and relevance) faces challenges in its interpretability. Metrics can be hard to trust due to potential LLM biases in scoring, and it's a considerable effort to create robust test sets that account for the diversity of real-world inputs.\n\n### Pitfalls of Vibes-Based Evals\n\nDespite the benefits, vibes-based evaluations have drawbacks. Initial impressions heavily influence later judgments.  Binary feedback lacks nuance in distinguishing various levels of success or failure.  Poorly formed questions or feedback can easily mislead the AI assistant. \n\n### Combining Approaches\n\nThe authors conclude that a combination is needed.  While improved benchmarks are necessary, direct, interactive experience is crucial for real-world evaluation.
